[X] Setup (Going for approval since I havent worked with it yet and it seems compatible and up to date

[X]  Running init tests (failed)

[X] Make the initial code compliant to the existing tests

[X] Decided to remove approval as a the framework for testing, it looks like an amazing framework but I feel like it would be overkill in this particular case

[] Set up MTest (I just feel like a MTest enviroment ran on a seperate solution makes this more accesible)

[] Write aditional tests to define the future architecture of the business case

[] Refactor code

    -Probably will seperate here depending on the archetypes that I touch(abstraction, etc)
    
[] Pass the refactored code

[] Check for best practices and code review

[] Final test
