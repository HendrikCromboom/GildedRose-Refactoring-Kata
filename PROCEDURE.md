[X]  Running init tests (failed)

[] Make the initial code compliant to the existing tests

[] Write aditional tests to define the future architecture of the business case

[] Refactor code

    -Probably will seperate here depending on the archetypes that I touch(abstraction, etc)
    
[] Pass the refactored code
