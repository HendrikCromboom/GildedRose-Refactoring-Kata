[X] Setup (Going for approval since I havent worked with it yet and it seems compatible and up to date

[X]  Running init tests (failed)

[X] Make the initial code compliant to the existing tests

[X] Decided to remove approval as a the framework for testing, it looks like an amazing framework but I feel like it would be overkill in this particular case

[X] Set up MTest (I just feel like a MTest enviroment ran on a seperate solution makes this more accesible)

[X] Write aditional tests to define the future architecture of the business case

[X] Refactor code
    
[X] Pass the refactored code

[X] Check for best practices and code review

[X] Final test
